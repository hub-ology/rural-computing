Rural Computing
===============

The Rural Computing Resources repository was started after a #RuralComputing Open Space at PyCon 2019.
It attempts to gather and outline links to resources that may be helpful to folks operating in or near
rural areas.  Many of these resources may also be applicable to computer education efforts in cities 
or urban areas.
