What is Rural Computing?
------------------------

Rural Computing is everything related to the advancement of computing in
rural areas.  This includes:

* encouraging problem solvers in rural areas to consider careers in computing
* early computer science education and computing hardware for rural problem solvers
* overcoming network connectivity limitations in rural areas
* a support network to help guide problem solvers along the path that's best for them: code schools, apprenticeships, formal CS education
* working with companies that support remote employment for rural areas

This Rural Computing repository was started after a #RuralComputing
Open Space at PyCon 2019.  It attempts to gather and outline links to information that may be helpful to folks working in one or more areas of Rural Computing.
Many of these resources may also be applicable to efforts in cities or urban areas.

We're working to establish various communication methods that folks can use to stay in touch and share information
in real time.
